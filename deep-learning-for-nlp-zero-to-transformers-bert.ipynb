    "# About this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a very hot topic right now and as belived by many experts '2020 is going to be NLP's Year' ,with its ever changing dynamics it is experiencing a boom , same as computer vision once did. Owing to its popularity Kaggle launched two NLP competitions recently and me being a lover of this Hot topic prepared myself to join in my first Kaggle Competition.<br><br>\n",
    "As I joined the competitions and since I was a complete beginner with Deep Learning Techniques for NLP, all my enthusiasm took a beating when I saw everyone Using all  kinds of BERT , everything just went over my head,I thought to quit but there is a special thing about Kaggle ,it just hooks you. I thought I have to learn someday , why not now , so I braced myself and sat on the learning curve. I wrote a kernel on the Tweet Sentiment Extraction competition that has now got a gold medal , it can be viewed here : https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/twitter-sentiment-extaction-analysis-eda-and-model <br><br>\n",
    "After 10 days of extensive learning(finishing all the latest NLP approaches) , I am back here to share my leaning , by writing a kernel that starts from the very Basic RNN's to built over , all the way to BERT . I invite you all to come and learn alongside with me and take a step closer towards becoming an NLP expert"

    "In this Notebook I will start with the very Basics of RNN's and Build all the way to latest deep learning architectures to solve NLP problems. It will cover the Following:\n",
    "* Simple RNN's\n",
    "* Word Embeddings : Definition and How to get them\n",
    "* LSTM's\n",
    "* GRU's\n",
    "* BI-Directional RNN's\n",
    "* Encoder-Decoder Models (Seq2Seq Models)\n",
    "* Attention Models\n",
    "* Transformers - Attention is all you need\n",
    "* BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "I will divide every Topic into four subsections:\n",
    "* Basic Overview\n",
    "* In-Depth Understanding : In this I will attach links of articles and videos to learn about the topic in depth\n",
    "* Code-Implementation\n",
    "* Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a comprehensive kernel and if you follow along till the end , I promise you would learn all the techniques completely\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the aim of this notebook is not to have a High LB score but to present a beginner guide to understand Deep Learning techniques used for NLP. Also after discussing all of these ideas , I will present a starter solution for this competiton"

In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words.
