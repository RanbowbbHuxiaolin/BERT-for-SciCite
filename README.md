## For project in CS4248
### But also for self-learning out of interest

I tried to use the notebook in kaggle. I found that they often use powerful GPU for computation
. So I turn to Featurize to rent RTX 4090 (need a stable internet connection).It took me a long
time to consult the version conflict problem for a libraryï¼Œwhich I managed to solve by create 
a new environment. (I guess it's another way of solving :joy: )

The memory is a question. Sometimes just remeber to free the memory that isn't used.

The update of some functions in the previous tutorial makes the replication a little bit harder. But many people once 
made the same mistake or run into such a question like that. So it's a good way to search the error on Google instead of CSND I think.
